Scammers will never go away from this world. This is a fact.

No matter how smart a person is, at she might have a weak point or time that a scammer might use on their advantage.

Almost everyday we see scam cases in the news. Only difference is small or big the scammed amount is.

Looking at my past, I definetely has experience of being scammed.

It was not real money, though. It was in an online game that I played back in high schools. Like first time people discovered IRC, we thought everyone was innocent. We'd trust a girl named IDs as real girl.

Back to the my first scam story. The game was [Ragnarok Online](http://renewal.playragnarok.com/). Back then we need to buy game time from prepaid card from shops.

I was young acolyte, around level 20 at that time of incident. I inspired to make hybrid build, balanced between dps and healing so I can play alone if nobody was around. Also known as battle acolyte build.

One fine Saturday evening, I logged in to my character, and hanged around at merchant NPC that sells armour in Prontera.

Chilling around while listening to the background music. It was really peaceful and I was in the mood to grind some experience. But first, I need to upgrade my gears.

At that time, I had around 20,000 [zenies](https://irowiki.org/wiki/Zeny) that I grinded my ass till I get myself to level 20. I was looking to buy a buckler to upgrade my armor stats.

I can't remember the price of the buckler at that time. It was expensive.

One alchemist entered the shop zone and PMed me, asking if I want a discount for any item that I want. Alchemist is a class that has a commerce skill that allows her to buy wares from any NPC at discounted rate.

Tempted by getting my desired buckler on discounted price, I agreed to send him the money. For some reason, I sent him all my zenies' savings.

And suddenly his character disconnected.

I waited, and waited. Even PMed him few times to get my money back.

An hour later, I realised that I got scammed real hard. All my (virtual) savings, gone. I was really mad at myself.

Invaluable lesson learnt that day. Never trust anyone online.

Luckily my first scam incident was in online game.

PS: [Prontera theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqijsweJzFQ) is indeed a masterpiece. Sometimes I play it back just to recall good times in Ragnarok Online. Ah, good times.
